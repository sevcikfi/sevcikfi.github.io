Just spinning up personal blog from Github pages. The purpose of this
website is to mainly stay as professional portfolio archive of some
sorts and mainly to learn how Jekyll and by analogy other Static
Site Generators (Hugo) works once some need arises in the future.

However, there isn't and likely much if any content to the name
of this person in the future.
