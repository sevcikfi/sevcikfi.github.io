Just spinning up personal blog from Github pages. The purpose of this
website is to mainly stay as professional portfolio archive of some
sorts and mainly to learn how Jekyll and by analogy other Static
Site Generators (Hugo) works once some need arises in the future.

However, there isn't and likely much if any content to the name of this
person in the future. They are not easily reached out to through any
means of the modern world anymore. If you happened to know them well,
however, there might be a young woman happy to forward your letters.
